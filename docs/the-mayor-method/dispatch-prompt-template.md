# Dispatch Prompt Template

Mayor sessions should use the following canonical prompts when dispatching
to background agents to ensure safe delegation.

Placeholders used throughout (substitute per project):

- `<MAYOR_CHECKOUT>` — absolute path of the mayor's primary checkout
- `<WORKTREE_ROOT>` — absolute path of the directory holding worker
  worktrees (e.g. a sibling directory next to the mayor checkout)
- `<ASSIGNED_WORKTREE>` — absolute path of the worktree the worker should
  edit (always a subdirectory of `<WORKTREE_ROOT>`)
- `<BEAD_ID>` — the bead identifier (project-specific prefix; here written
  generically rather than with any one project's prefix)

## Worktree boundary — mandatory in every editing dispatch

### Root cause (why the block exists)

Workers understand they're assigned to separate worktrees, and their shell
commands generally use the right `workdir`. The failure mode is subtler:
**`apply_patch` has no explicit `workdir`**, so relative patch paths can
resolve against the session/default checkout, not the shell worktree the
worker just used. "Use your worktree" is not a strong enough prompt. Patch
tools and shell tools do not share the same scoping guarantees.

### The safe delegation pattern

- Shell commands use `workdir` / `cd` inside the assigned worktree.
- Edit tools use paths that are **relative to the session root** and
  explicitly walk into the assigned worktree.
- The worker checks both the worker worktree AND the mayor checkout
  immediately after the first edit.


Repo-relative paths are **forbidden** for worker `apply_patch` calls
unless the agent session root is itself the assigned worker worktree.

### The block (paste verbatim into every editing-worker dispatch)

```text
WORKTREE BOUNDARY - MANDATORY

Your assigned worktree is:
<ASSIGNED_WORKTREE>

The mayor checkout is:
<MAYOR_CHECKOUT>

Never edit the mayor checkout.

Shell workdir is not enough protection. apply_patch has no workdir, so
relative patch paths can land in the mayor checkout.

Before every file edit, run:

pwd; git rev-parse --show-toplevel; git status --short --branch

Only edit if git rev-parse --show-toplevel prints exactly:
<ASSIGNED_WORKTREE>

When using apply_patch or any edit tool, use absolute file paths under
<ASSIGNED_WORKTREE> if the tool accepts them.

If the edit tool does not accept absolute paths, use paths relative to
the session root that explicitly target the worker worktree:

<WORKTREE_ROOT>/<WORKTREE_NAME>/<repo-relative-path>

Never use bare repo-relative edit paths unless `git rev-parse
--show-toplevel` for the agent session root is itself the assigned
worktree.

After the first edit, immediately run:

git -C <ASSIGNED_WORKTREE> status --short --branch
git -C <MAYOR_CHECKOUT> status --short --branch

Continue only if the worker worktree is dirty and the mayor checkout
did not receive code edits.

If any edit lands outside <ASSIGNED_WORKTREE>, stop immediately and
report it. Do not repair, restore, commit, or push until the mayor
tells you what to do.
```

**Note:** A PreToolUse hook also guards against path-resolution leaks
automatically. The boundary block above is defense-in-depth.

### Mayor checks after dispatch

- Check the mayor checkout immediately after dispatching:
  `git status --short --branch`.
- If the mayor checkout gains unexpected code edits, interrupt the
  worker, preserve the edits into the worker worktree, then restore
  the mayor checkout — only specific known files; never broad resets.

## Common preamble (every dispatch)

```
You are implementing bead **<BEAD_ID>** in <project description>.

<project stance, obtained from operator — pre-alpha, production-stable, etc.>
```

## Worktree path convention

Worker worktrees live under `ai/worktrees/`. They are created
automatically when a worker agent with `isolation: worktree` starts.
The worktree is cleaned up automatically if the worker makes no changes.

## Shape 1 — Solo bead implementation

```
<COMMON PREAMBLE>

## Bead

```
<verbatim bead title + priority + source-finding-doc>
```

## Context

<2-4 paragraphs explaining what's wrong and why it matters; cite file:line>

## Concrete steps

1. <numbered, file:line-precise actions>
2. ...

## Process

1. You are running in an isolated worktree. Verify with
   `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` before any edit.
2. Include worktree-boundary block (see Constraints).
3. `bd update <BEAD_ID> --claim` then `bd update <BEAD_ID> --status=in_progress`.
4. Implement.
5. Run quality gates: `<exact commands>`.
6. Push branch + `gh pr create` with title `<scope>(<artefact>): <summary> (<BEAD_ID>)`.

## Return

Under <N> words: PR URL + per-step summary + test deltas.

<COMMON CONSTRAINTS>
```

---

## Shape 2 — Cluster (multiple beads, single PR, sequenced commits)

```
<COMMON PREAMBLE adapted for "CLUSTER of N beads">

## Cluster: "<descriptive name>"

N beads from <audit/source>. Findings (local-only):
`ai/findings/<doc>.md`. Surface: <shared file/artefact>.

## Beads + commit ordering (smallest cleanup → biggest correctness fix)

**Commit format**: `<scope>(<artefact>): <summary> (<BEAD_ID>)`.

1. **<BEAD_ID-1> (P3)** — <one-line + scope>
2. **<BEAD_ID-2> (P3)** — <one-line>
...
N. **<BEAD_ID-N> (P1 BUG)** — <one-line + concrete fix sketch + regression test ask>

## Process

1. You are running in an isolated worktree. Verify with
   `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` before any edit.
2. Include worktree-boundary block.
3. For each bead: `bd update <BEAD_ID> --claim` + `--status=in_progress`
   BEFORE that bead's commit.
4. Run quality gates after EACH commit. After ALL: full regression.
5. Push + `gh pr create` with title
   `<scope>(<artefact>): <cluster name> (N beads incl. <P1 highlights>)`.

## Return

Under <N> words: PR URL + per-bead one-line + test deltas + cross-bead unifications.

<COMMON CONSTRAINTS>
```

Key cluster discipline:

- **Smallest+safest commit first; biggest correctness fix last.** If the
  P1 fix breaks something, the small refactors land cleanly first.
- **Spell out commit ordering.** Don't leave it to the agent.
- **Note cross-bead unifications.** They surface real wins (e.g. a cluster
  may find a multi-commit refactor arc shared across several beads, or
  unify duplicate helper code that wasn't previously visible as a
  single concern).
- **Bead pre-claim before each commit.** So bd state mirrors commit
  history one-to-one and a stalled cluster leaves a clean partial trail.

---

## Shape 3 — Audit (read-only research)

```
<COMMON PREAMBLE adapted for "audit bead <BEAD_ID>">

## Goal

Read `<surface>` end-to-end and produce a findings report identifying:
1. **Correctness drifts** — places where impl diverges from spec
2. **Performance hotspots** — allocations, missed batching, double-walks
3. **API hygiene** — fn names, public surface, missing docstrings
4. **Testing gaps** — concurrency, hot-reload, error paths
5. **Cross-artefact coupling**

## Reference

- <surface paths>
- <relevant spec docs>
- <recent landings affecting this surface — name them so the audit reads
  the post-landing reality>
- <prior audit findings docs to avoid re-discovering>

## Process

1. You are running in an isolated worktree. Verify with
   `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` before any edit.
2. Include worktree-boundary block.
3. `bd update <BEAD_ID> --status=in_progress`.
4. **WRITE FINDINGS DOC FIRST** to
   `ai/findings/<surface>-slice-audit-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
   (local-only; gitignored — `ai/findings/` is not tracked).
   Do all analysis + write findings BEFORE running any `bd create`.
   Earlier audits stalled mid-bead-filing and lost analysis.
5. File follow-ons via `bd create` ONE AT A TIME (after each, append the
   new bead ID to <BEAD_ID> notes — partial progress stays durable).
6. Close <BEAD_ID> with verdict + cross-refs.
7. **No PR by default.** Findings docs are local-only and must NOT be
   committed. Trivial one-line obvious fixes are OK to bundle into a
   small PR.

## Return

Under 400 words: per-finding file:line citations + follow-on bead IDs +
severity counts (HIGH/MED/LOW/DEFER) + verdict.

<COMMON CONSTRAINTS adapted: "You're READING surfaces concurrent agents
are writing — that's fine for audits but flag any rendezvous concerns.">
```

Critical learnings:

- **Findings doc FIRST, before any `bd create`.** Audit work can stall
  mid-bead-filing (watchdog timeout, model error). Doc-first preserves
  the analysis even if the bead-filing loop never completes.
- **One bd-create at a time + update parent notes after each.** Partial
  progress survives a watchdog timeout.
- **Name the recent landings** so the audit reads the current reality,
  not a stale picture.
- **Severity tags** (HIGH/MED/LOW/DEFER) make later cluster-formation
  trivial.
- **`ai/findings/` is gitignored.** Never open a PR that adds a findings
  doc. Convert actionable findings into bead bodies / spec / docs.

---

## Shape 4 — Cluster reviewer (research + recommendation only, no dispatch)

```
You are a clustering reviewer for the project's bead queue.
**Research + recommendation only — do NOT dispatch agents, do NOT change
bd state.** Report findings.

## Context

<repo + time>

## Cluster policy (the operator's words verbatim)

> When multiple open beads target the same surface ... [policy text]

## In-flight (do NOT recommend changes that touch these)

<agents working + surfaces>
<PRs in queue + surfaces locked>

## Your task

1. Enumerate beads filed in last ~30 min via
   `git log -p --since='35 minutes ago' -- .beads/issues.jsonl`.
2. For each, determine surface via `bd show <id>`.
3. Decide per-bead:
   - (A) Add to in-flight cluster
   - (B) Form NEW cluster (3+ beads on shared non-in-flight surface)
   - (C) Solo dispatch (P0/P1 correctness, structural >250 LoC,
         decision-resolved, cross-cutting)
   - (D) Defer
4. <Specific question about this round's pattern>

## Output format

<structured template>

## Net recommendation

2-3 sentences. Specific timing + dispatch shape.
```

Used between major dispatch waves to shape the next round. Saves operator
effort by surfacing the optimal cluster shape from the audit-then-cluster
cycle. **Read-only — no worktree boundary block needed.**

---

## Shape 5 — Fix CI failure on a specific PR

```
<COMMON PREAMBLE>

PR #NNNN (`<title>`) has a CI failure: `<failing check>`.

## Failure

```
<paste failing log lines verbatim>
```

## Hypotheses (likely)

1. <root cause guess 1>
2. <root cause guess 2>

## Concrete steps

1. **Worktree**: You are in an isolated worktree. Verify
   `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` and check out the PR branch:
   `git checkout <branch>`.
2. Include worktree-boundary block.
3. <investigation steps>
4. **Pick the fix**:
   - **(A)** <surgical option>
   - **(B)** <medium option>
   - **(C)** Skip + file follow-on bead — appropriate when the project
     stance allows a safe-out (e.g. pre-alpha) and (A)/(B) prove deeper
     than the bead's scope.
5. Verify locally if possible.
6. Push fix to PR branch (not main).

## Return

Under 300 words: root cause + fix chosen + verification.

<COMMON CONSTRAINTS — additional: "Push to existing PR branch, not main.">
```

Diagnosis often surfaces deeper insight than the failure log shows. A
classic example: "X subsystem can't find port" turns out to be a missing
callback option in a higher layer, not the network failure the log
suggested. Worker should test their hypothesis before applying the fix.

---

## What goes WRONG without these patterns

- **Agents add back-compat shims by default.** Pre-alpha posture must be
  explicit in every prompt.
- **Same-file races between concurrent agents.** "Concurrent agents on
  disjoint surfaces: <list>" prevents this.
- **Workers leak edits into mayor checkout.** The worktree-boundary block
  (separate doc) is the only reliable defence.
- **Stalled agents lose analysis.** "Findings doc FIRST" recovery protocol
  salvages partial progress.
- **Clusters split when they should be one PR.** Cluster reviewer
  pre-validates dispatch shape.
- **Hot-zone files cause merge conflicts.** Explicit hot-zone list in every
  prompt.
- **Agents re-discover known issues.** Naming recent landings + prior
  findings docs prevents this.
- **Generic prompts produce generic work.** Always include file:line
  citations + concrete fix sketches.
- **Findings docs leak into PRs.** `ai/findings/` is gitignored; never
  commit one.
- **Branch-delete-on-merge fails.** See Mayor Merge Protocol in
  [`bootstrap.md`](./bootstrap.md) (the PR merge `/loop` block).

## What goes RIGHT with these patterns

A long live Mayor session that ran these patterns end-to-end tends to
produce, in a single working day:

- A dozen or more audit umbrellas that surface dozens of follow-on
  beads; those beads cluster cleanly and ship as a small number of PRs
  with substantive per-PR scope rather than churn.
- Multiple P1 correctness fixes shipped alongside measurable
  performance wins (the audit-then-cluster cycle surfaces inefficiencies
  the bead system hadn't framed as bugs).
- API surfaces tighten as cross-bead unifications get spotted during
  cluster authoring.
- The project's stance (pre-alpha, production-stable, refactor-only,
  etc.) becomes culture — agents reach for the right shape of fix by
  default instead of needing the policy re-stated in every prompt.

The compounding effect is the point: each audit informs the next
cluster; each merged cluster removes scope from the next audit; the
operator's attention concentrates on decisions instead of bookkeeping.

## Pointers to canonical examples

These are project-specific. When applying the method to a new project,
record your own canonical examples here once you have them:

- **Solo done well**: <bead-id + 1-line of why this is exemplary>
- **Cluster done well**: <cluster name + bead-count + a surprise the
  cluster surfaced that wasn't visible bead-by-bead>
- **Audit done well**: <audit bead-id + per-finding follow-on count +
  the analytical move that made it valuable>
- **CI fix done well**: <bead-id + the diagnosis-vs-surface-log
  distinction the worker drew>

Keep the list short. Three or four good examples teach a new mayor more
than thirty mediocre ones.
